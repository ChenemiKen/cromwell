In page 4, Module 1 assignment's file below the topic summative assessment, the requirement for each task (A&B) is explained and to the side are the notes mentioned for each task to follow on for doing the tasks. The first task is to do 7 annotated A3-sized PowerPoint boards (one board for each interior design element) to convey the understanding of the topics read. The boards must reflect on the content and prove the evidence of research from a wide range of research(primary and secondary research) of resources but you don't have to do everything mentioned. Primary research may include questionnaires (in which it doesn't have to be real, it can be from your own creation if you get it), Observations, Sketching, construction of models, and Photography (in which you can set examples from places that surround your area or from the internet as if it's photographed).If you have visited a museum in your country, you can set it as an example for the topics included (it be a solid add-on). While secondary research is easy such as internet research, published texts, journals, magazines etc., media and documentaries. As for Task B, research ONE of the designers or architects mentioned in MODULE 1 PDF file but in depth on the utilization of the same 7 interior design elements in their work in a 1000-word illustrated report (Microsoft word document ESSAY WRITING). Present the report well considering the design styles used by the chosen designer from readings of MODULE 1 PDF file. BOTH TASKS (A&B) MUST BE SUBMITTED WITH HARVARD REFERENCING SHEETS. Finally task 3 is 5 (pages) A4-sized noting after the previous tasks but will need manual croaky sketching to be added into. After finishing Task A & B reflect down what thoughts, designs, or designers inspired you from the overall research or readings and why (IF YOU CAN) as if it's a personal diary so it's not like an essay or something. Include a design or two (from the internet) from the designer chosen in Task B and explain what makes it special and eye catching. Develop one or two settings even if croaky using the seven interior design elements (manually) into the Microsoft Word noting and reflect on the research if you can. Write down an analyzation on why the readings and this specific research would be useful for any interior designer. Express why transitional interior design would be picked the least in comparison with contemporary (modern) or heritage interior design. \n\nI will be working with whoever I will hire a lot this year :)", 'posted_date': '2021-10-28 03:47:47'}
